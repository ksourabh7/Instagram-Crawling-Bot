# Web Crawling Bot for Data Extraction

This repository contains a crawling script built with Puppeteer and Node.js that allows you to extract specific data, such as text, images, and structured content, from Instagram reels. The script mimics human-like scrolling behavior to ensure a more natural browsing experience.

## Features

- Automated data extraction: The bot is designed to automate the process of collecting data from Instagram by scrolling the window on a random basis, simulating human-like movements.

- Data types: The bot is capable of extracting link of the reel. You can customise the code based on requiremnets.

- Randomization: To mimic human behavior and avoid detection, the bot introduces randomness in its scrolling patterns, imitating the touch movements of human hands.

## Requirements

To use the web crawling bot, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Node.js. You can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
- Puppeteer (JavaScript library)

You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install puppeteer
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ksourabh7/Instagram-Crawling-Bot.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. Customize the crawling script according to your specific data extraction needs. You can modify the scrolling patterns, target URLs, data extraction methods, and more in the provided JavaScript file.

4. Run the crawling script using Node.js:
```
npm run puppeteer.js
```


## Limitations and Legal Considerations

- Respect website policies: Ensure that your web crawling activities comply with the terms of service, policies, and legal requirements of the target website, such as Instagram. Always obtain proper authorization and use the bot responsibly.

- API alternatives: It's recommended to explore official APIs or authorized methods provided by the target website for data extraction before resorting to web crawling. APIs often provide a more structured and reliable approach to accessing data.

- Throttling and rate limiting: Implement mechanisms in your bot to control the rate of crawling, such as introducing delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the target website's server or violating their rate limits.
